File: Math.uuid.js
Version: 1.3
Change History:
  v1.0 - first release
  v1.1 - less code and 2x performance boost (by minimizing calls to Math.random())
  v1.2 - Add support for generating non-standard uuids of arbitrary length
  v1.3 - Fixed IE7 bug (can't use []'s to access string chars.  Thanks, Brian R.)
  v1.4 - Changed method to be "Math.uuid". Added support for radix argument.  Use module pattern for better encapsulation.

/*
 * Generate a random uuid.
 *
 * USAGE: Math.uuid(length, radix)
 *   length - the desired number of characters
 *   radix  - the number of allowable values for each character.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 *   // No arguments  - returns RFC4122, version 4 ID
 *   >>> Math.uuid()
 *   "92329D39-6F5C-4520-ABFC-AAB64544E172"
 * 
 *   // One argument - returns ID of the specified length
 *   >>> Math.uuid(15)     // 15 character ID (default base=62)
 *   "VcydxgltxrVZSTV"
 *
 *   // Two arguments - returns ID of the specified length, and radix. (Radix must be <= 62)
 *   >>> Math.uuid(8, 2)  // 8 character ID (base=2)
 *   "01001010"
 *   >>> Math.uuid(8, 10) // 8 character ID (base=10)
 *   "47473046"
 *   >>> Math.uuid(8, 16) // 8 character ID (base=16)
 *   "098F4D35"
